# PhotoOfTheDay

1. This app is developed using SwiftUI and Combine based on MVVM architecture.
2. Since user can see one image everyday and they might open the app many times in a day, I decided to save image into cache directory in order to prevent unnecessary data download.
3. I separated View and ViewModel folders. In the case of a large-scale project, we can have View and ViewModels in one folder for each feature of the app.
